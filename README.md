## School 42 Sudoku Project - Implemented in C w/ DFS
To run the Sudoku program:
1. Compile the file with `gcc -o sudoku *.c`
 2. Run `./sudoku line1 line2 line3 line4 line5 line6 line7 line8 line9 | cat -e`. 
Where each line is a 9-char string, number to indicate existing sudoku, . to indicate empty space. 
Example `/rush-1 "9...7...." "2...9..53" ".6..124.." "84...1.9." "5.....8.." ".31..4..." "..37..68." ".9..5.741" "47......." | cat -e`
